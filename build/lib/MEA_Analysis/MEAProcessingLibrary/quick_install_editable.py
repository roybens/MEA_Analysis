"""
quick_install_editable.py

This script is used to quickly update and install the requirements associated with the MEAProcessingLibrary 
during development.

The script uses pipreqs, a package that automatically updates requirements.txt based on the imports in your 
project. It is required to be installed in order to run this script.

The script also uses 'pip install -e' to install MEAProcessingLibrary in editable mode. 
This means that changes to the code will be reflected in the package without needing to reinstall it. 
This works by creating a symbolic link to the package in the site-packages folder of your Python environment.
