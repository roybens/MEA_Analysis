class Sequence:
    """Holds a sequence of commands.

    Args:
        initial_delay (samples) : how many samples to delay the first
            command.

    The commands contained in a sequence are executed immediately after
    each other.

    Thus, the timing between consecutive commands can be precisely
    controlled, down to a resolution of 50 Âµs. The jitter between
    consecutive commands is much less than than.  Particularly for
    sequences implementing electrical stimulation pulses, this is
    relevant. For a more detailed discussion about that, please see the
    introduction of this document.

    It can happen, that the first command of the sequence gets executed
    before all remaining commands were successfully downloaded. In that
    case the timing would not be precise anymore. To prevent this from
    happening, it is good practise to insert a delay command right at
    the beginning of the sequence. This is done through  the parameter
    `initial_delay`. Delaying for 100 samples (i.e. 5 ms) should be
    enough in virtually all cases.

    The sequences are managed on the server. As many sequences as needed
    can be generated. They will be maintained on the server. Whenever
    a sequence object in the python code gets deleted, either through
    explicitely calling del or if the code goes out of scope, the
    respective sequence in the server will also be removed:

    >>> s1 = maxlab.Sequence()
    >>> s1.append( maxlab.system.DelaySamples(4) )
    >>> del s1 # All information about Sequence s1 is removed from the server

    >>> def func(samples):
    >>>     s = maxlab.Sequence()
    >>>     s.append(maxlab.system.DelaySamples(samples))
    >>>     return 0 # As soon as the function finishes, the sequence s is removed from the server
