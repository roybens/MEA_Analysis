## How to load configurations and run recordings
#
#
# 0. Initialize system into a defined state
#
#    It is best to initialize the system into a defined state beforefile:///usr/share/doc/HTML/index.html
#    Starting any script. This way, one can be sure that the system
#    is always in the same state while running the script, regardless
#    of what has been done before with it.
#
#
# 1. Load your electrode selection
#
#    We use an existing config file to route the electrodes of interest.
#
# 2. Start a recording
#
#    Once we are ready to start an experiment e.g. a stimulation protocol
#    we can start a recording.
#
# 3. Stop and store the recording
#
#    When our experiment is done, we can stop the recording and store the data
#    at a location of our choice.
#

# If we want to stimulate during our experiment, we also issue the following command:

#
# This is needed, because by default the stimulation units are
# powered off globally...

array.load_config(name_of_configuration)

# After loading the configuration, we could also add more recording or stimulation
# electrodes. Once everything is setup according to our needs, we need to download
# the prepared array configuration to the chip

# If we use the new data format and also store the signal traces, we must declare which electrodes
# we want to store data from. This can be set through the group_define function which has the following form:
# s.group_define(well_nr, "any_name", list_of_channels_to_record_from)
# e.g s.group_define(0, "all_channels", range(1024)) will store data from all 1024 channels
# for the first well and store in the group 'all_channels'.
# In case you need, you can also define multiple groups for same recording, with a set of channels.
# These groups can also have overlapping channels. For example if you stimulate on channel 200:
# s.group_define(0, "stim_channel", [200])
# s.group_define(0, "all", range(1024))
s.group_delete_all()
